Intra-Domain Routing Intra-Domain Routing(IDR) offers a mechanism for user segmentation. For a small or medium size company, a single domain may be sufficient, but for a multinational or an IP telephony service provider, it may not. For a small company with less than 50 users, you may define a domain sip.domain.com . Regardless of how many offices they have, the chances are that they still need to communicate with each other, and therefore we keep them in the same Domain. Needless to say, that in a company this size you are not going to run out usernames. A multinational company like Walmart have thousands of stores that operate independently. In such a case, you need a multi-domain setting. For example, you may define the domains sip.0001.walmart.com and sip.0002.walmart.com , and... you get the idea. Double Agents Yes, you can have double Agents, or Agents that exist in a multi-domain setup. All you need to do is include the Domain in the Agent's spec.domain[*] list. In the example before, John can send or receive calls from both domains, while the rest of the Agents are only allowed to call within the Domain. Single Domain Example The following yaml configuration shows a simple setup, involving one Domain and two Agents: Domain configuration - apiVersion : v1beta1 kind : Domain metadata : name : Local Office spec : context : domainUri : sip.local Agents configuration - apiVersion : v1beta1 kind : Agent metadata : name : John Doe spec : credentials : username : john secret : 1234 domains : [ sip.local ] - kind : Agent apiVersion : v1beta1 metadata : name : Janie Doe spec : credentials : username : janie secret : 1234 domains : [ sip.local ] Voila! That's all the configuration you need for intra-domain communication. For calls outside the Domain, see \"Domain Egress Routing\" section and to receive calls from the PSTN check section \"Domain Ingress Routing.\" To configure your sip devices use the information found in config/agents.yml . Also, you must use the Host/IP of Routr server as the OUTBOUND PROXY of your sip device. Routing Rules The following rules apply to Intra-Domain Routing: Agents can only call other Agents in the same Domain Agents must belong to a Domain Agents Are not allowed to send a Digest username different than the username in the From-Header Domain Ingress Routing In Routr, the process of receiving a call from PSTN to a Domain is as Domain Ingress Routing(DIR) and it is done using a Gateway resource. The yaml file config/gateways.yml contains the Gateways. The following example shows a typical Gateway configuration. - apiVersion : v1beta1 kind : Gateway metadata : name : Plain Old Phone Service Provider spec : regService : host : sip.provider.net credentials : username : gwuser secret : gwsecret transport : udp registries : [ sip.nyc.provider.net ] # These are additional registrars within the provider s network You also need to define Numbers. Routr uses the Address Of Record(AOR) to routes incoming calls from a Number to an existing Agent or Peer. The AOR must be available in the location service at the time of the call, or the call gets rejected. Please examine the following example: - apiVersion : v1beta1 kind : Number metadata : gwRef : dd50baa4 geoInfo : city : Columbus, GA country : USA countryISOCode : US spec : location : telUri : tel:17066041487 aorLink : sip:john@sip.local # This is the sip uri of an agent that is expected to be logged in Easy right? Any incoming call is routed from this Gateway and Number to \"Jhon Doe\" @ Ocean New York. Routing Rules The spec.location block of a Number resource configuration, determines the path of an inbound call from the PSTN. The aorLink refers to an Address of Record(Agent or Peer) that is available in the location service . Domain Egress Routing Domain Egress Routing(DER) is the way that Routr deals with a call request to a callee that exists in the Public Switched Telephone Network(PSTN) and not in the callers' Domain. The EgressPolicy consists of a rule , and a numberRef defined in the spec.context section of Domains resources. The rule and numberRef is defined as follows: rule is a regex to match callee in the call request. The location service uses this only after a search in the caller's Domain first. numberRef is the identifier of the Number that will to route the call. The Number must already exist and have a parent Gateway. Routing Rules Agents can only perform outbound calls using the Egress Policy of their Domains. Peers Routing Peers are very similar to Agents, but they are not bound to any Domain, and usually, collocated in the same network with Routr. A typical case is peering with Asterisk, where Asterisk acts as a Media Server and Routr provides the signaling. Peers can perform inbound/outbound signaling within the network without any special consideration since they exist inside the Location Service just like Agents. So it is possible to perform signaling from Peer to Peer, Peer to Agent. The same is true for Inbound from the PSTN. For example, we can redirect incoming calls from the PSTN using the spec.location settings in the numbers.yml configuration file. Routing Rules Agents are not allowed to call Peers. A future version of the Peer resource might feature a spec.acceptFrom.* field to allow calls from Domains or specific Agents.","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"concepts/#intra-domain-routing","text":"Intra-Domain Routing(IDR) offers a mechanism for user segmentation.

Installation To get the Routr Command-Line Tool run the following command: npm install -g routr-ctl The command-line tool is now globally accessible. Login to a Routr server To login to a Routr server, use the login command. rctl login https://127.0.0.1:4567/api/ { apiVersion } -u admin -p changeit The current API version is v1beta1 Syntax Use the following syntax to run rctl commands from your terminal window: rctl COMMAND [REF] [flags] where COMMAND , subcommand REF , and flags are: COMMAND : Specifies the operation that you want to perform on one or more resources. For example, create, get, delete, locate(loc). subcommand : Specifies the resource type. Resource types are case-sensitive, and you can specify the singular, plural, or abbreviated forms. For example, the following commands produce the same output: $ rctl get gateway gweef506 $ rctl get gateways gweef506 $ rctl get gw gweef506 REF : Specifies the reference to the resource. References are case-sensitive. For a full list, omit the reference. For example, $ rctl get agents . flags : Specifies optional flags. For example, you can use the --filter to further reduce the output of the get command . The --filter flag uses JsonPath to perform the filtering. The root is always '$'. All you need to add is the path to the property and the filter operators. For example: # This returns all the Numbers in Gateway gweef506 rctl get numbers --filter @.metadata.gwRef== gweef506 If you need help, just run rctl --help from the terminal window. $ rctl --help usage: rctl [ -h ] [ -v ] COMMAND ...

In other words, Asterisk is in charge of the IVR, voice mail, call recording, while Routr deals with connecting Agents, Peers, and Gateways. The following illustration depicts our scenario: Content Requirements Configuration Overview Configuring Asterisk Calling Asterisk from John\u2019s device What\u2019s Next? Requirements This tutorial assumes the following: You have a SIP phone connected to the same LAN as Routr and Asterisk If using a hardware phone, this can reach Asterisk and Routr and the other way around You have a fresh installation of Routr and Asterisk Before starting this guide make sure to have a fresh installation of Routr server. Configuration Overview With a fresh installation of Routr , you have most of the configuration you need to follow this tutorial. We, however, need to make some minor changes to configuration files to run our scenario. The first file we need to examine and change is config/peers.yml . Make a note of the username and secret for the Peer \"ast\" since we are using this to configure Asterisk. Also, search for the field spec.device and change it to match the Agents domain( sip.local ). The file now looks similar to this: config/peers.yml - apiVersion: v1beta1 kind: Peer metadata: name: Asterisk PBX spec: device: sip.local credentials: username: ast secret: 1234 Head to the console and run the command rctl -- get peers to confirm that the Peer exist. The result should be as follows: Next, we focus our attention on domains.yml and agents.yml . With a fresh installation, we don't need to make any changes to these files. However, you could run the commands get domains and get agents to ensure that both, the Agent and the Domain, exist on the server. Your output should look similar to: Use the information in agents.yml to configure your SIP phone. The relevant information is found in spec.credentials . Mine looks like this: Make the adjustments based on your prefer SIP phone. You can verify that your device registered correctly with Routr by running the locate command: Configuring Asterisk Using PJSIP Backup your pjsip.conf and pjsip_wizard.conf . Update your pjsip.conf with the following: [transport-tcp] type=transport protocol=tcp bind=0.0.0.0:6060 Then, in your pjsip_wizard.conf: [routr] type = wizard sends_auth = yes sends_registrations = yes remote_hosts = 192.168.1.2 outbound_auth/username = ast outbound_auth/password = 1234 registration/retry_interval = 10 registration/expiration = 900 endpoint/allow = ulaw endpoint/allow = alaw endpoint/allow = opus endpoint/context = default transport = transport-tcp Using the \"old\" Chan SIP First backup your sip.conf . Then, replace your configuration and edit the file to reflect the following: [general] udpbindaddr=0.0.0.0:6060 context=default register = ast:1234@192.168.1.2:5060/1001 ; This information must match the credentials in `config/peers.yml` Configuring the Dialplan We are going to use a very simple dialplan to play a sound file. Again, make a backup of your configuration and replace its content with this: [default] exten = 1001,1,Answer exten = 1001,n,Playback(tt-monkeys) exten = 1001,n,Hangup Restart your Asterisk and check the location service.

Keep in mind that Routr only secures the signaling and that the endpoints are ultimately responsible for securing the media. For this guide, we used a fictitious domain name to demonstrate the process of securing the signaling path Creating a Java Keystore(.JKS) certificate We need a keystore (.jks) to properly handling the certificates. The following steps create a valid keystore file using a self-signed method or using the free Let's Encrypt service . Creating a self-signed Certificate Perhaps the easiest way to create a valid certificate for Routr is using a self-signed certificate. To generate the certificate change into etc/certs in your Routr installation and run the following script: keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA \\ -noprompt \\ -alias routr \\ -keystore domains-cert.jks \\ -storepass changeit \\ -keypass changeit \\ -validity 365 \\ -keysize 2048 \\ -dname CN=sip.ocean.com, OU=OSS, O=Your Company Inc, L=Sanford, ST=NC, C=US \\ -ext SAN = dns:sip.ocean.com,dns:localhost,ip:127.0.0.1 Remember to adjust the values to match your project's information. WSS does not work with a self-signed certificate. However, you can add a security exception by using https instead of wss in your browser's search bar and then accepting the security certificate. Creating a Certificate using Let's Encrypt The recommended way to create a valid certificate for Routr is using the free service Let's Encrypt . Please go to https://letsencrypt.org/ for details on how to install the required tooling. To generate the certificate, use the following steps: Create keys certbot certonly --standalone -d sip.ocean.com --email admin@sip.ocean.com Change to the directory where we created the certificates(generally at /etc/letsencrypt/live/sip.ocean.com).

Their role is to provide media capabilities such as IVR, Voicemail, Conferencing, Recording, and even video. Both Asterisk and FreeSWITCH are very good at what they do, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Routr is not a PBX and does not pretend to solve the same issue. Routr focuses on the SIP Server role. Routr vs Kamailio/OpenSER? Typically, large VoIP networks and Unified Communication platforms include SIP servers of some sort.

These rules are the core of Routr, in addition to the typical SIP Server the functions such as Proxy, Location, and Registrar. The primary integration points are the data abstraction layer, the event publisher, and the RESTful API. This integration points, allow for easy integration with third-party software. Use cases Routr specializes in the management of SIP resources and domain-centric routing strategies. It works well in front of the Media servers like Asterisk or FreeSWITCH. Routr runs in all major operating systems, in Docker , and Kubernetes . Unlike Kamailio and OpenSIPS, Routr does not require any scripting to perform any of its typical routing tasks.
