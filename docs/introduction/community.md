Routr is developed in the open. Here are some of the channels we use to communicate and contribute:

**IRC**: `#routr` on [irc.freenode.net](https://freenode.net/) (for the easiest start, join via [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#routr:matrix.org))

(The IRC channel connects our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/fonoster/routr) and [Slack](https://fonosterteam.typeform.com/to/Xy8Oc0) communities)

**User mailing lists:**

- [routr-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/routr-announce) – for announcements like new releases
- [routr-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/routr-users) – for discussions around Routr usage and community support

**Twitter:** [@Fonoster](https://twitter.com/fonoster)

**Issue tracker:** Use the GitHub issue tracker for the various [Routr repositories](https://github.com/fonoster/) to file bugs and features request. If you need support, please send your questions to the routr-users mailing list rather than filing a GitHub issue.

>Please do not ask individual project members for support. Use the channels above instead, where the whole community can help you and benefit from the solutions provided. If community support is insufficient for your situation, please refer to the Commercial Support section below.

## Developer Summits

We strive to be as open and public as possible. Technical discussions happen on the development list, our in-person meeting notes are public, and we have public calls. Below, you can find links to our developer summits at JConfDominicana 2019. These deveolper summits are open to join upon request as long as we have capacity. Preference is given to friendly projects and companies, plus diversity. Attendees are free not to be listed in the public meeting notes.
