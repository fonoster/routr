Most Routr components are written in Javascript(with Oracle Nashorn). Some are also written in Java.

### What will happen once Nashorn is deprecated?

The announcement Nashorn will soon be [deprecated](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/335) is definitely a concern. The current course of action is to wait and see if GraalJS is viable replacement for Nashorn or completely re-write the project in Java. In either case, we believe we have time to make the decision later this year.
