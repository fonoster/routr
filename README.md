## Example configuration

Consider a situation where you want to deploy the server and send all PSTN traffic to a conference room in Asterisk. For such a scenario, you must combine the `Peer` and `Number` resources and the `Location` service.

First, you will start by creating a Peer configuration for your Asterisk server similar to the following one:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v2draft1",
  "kind": "Peer",
  "ref": "peer-01",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Asterisk (Media Server)"
  },
  "spec": {
    "username": "asterisk",
    "aor": "backend:conference",
    "credentialsRef": "credentials-01",
    "contactAddr": "192.168.1.2:6060"
  }
}
```

Every Asterik server that registers using the `crd6t67r1` credentials will be grouped under the `backend:conference` Address of Record (AOR). Next, we need to tell Routr to map all inbound calls from given number to the conference room in Asterik. For that, we use the `aorLink` and `sessionAffinityHeader` on the desired Number. Here is an example: 

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v2draft1",
  "kind": "Number",
  "ref": "number-01",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "(706)604-1487",
    "geoInfo": {
      "city": "Columbus, GA",
      "country": "USA",
      "countryISOCode": "US"
    }
  },
  "spec": {
    "trunkRef": "trunk-01",
    "location": {
      "telUrl": "tel:+17066041487",
      "aorLink": "backend:conference",
      "sessionAffinityHeader": "x-room-id",
      "extraHeaders": [{
        "name": "x-room-id",
        "value": "jsa-shqm-iyo"
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, we configure the Location service to load-balance the traffic based on the `least-sessions` algorithm.

> We need Session Affinity to ensure all calls for a given `x-room-id` go to the same Asterisk server.

```json
{
  "kind": "Location",
  "apiVersion": "v2draft1",
  "metadata": {
    "region": "us-east1"
  },
  "spec": {
    "bindAddr": "0.0.0.0:51902",
    "cache": {
      "provider": "memory"
    },
    "backends": [
      {
        "ref": "conference",
        "balancingAlgorithm": "least-sessions",
        "withSessionAffinity": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The last scenario is just one of the many possible scenarios you can accomplish with Routr (v2). Please spend some time getting familiar with the [configuration files](https://github.com/fonoster/routr/blob/v2/CONNECT.md).

## Deployment

### Instant Server deployment with Docker and Compose

For a quick demo of Routr follow the next two steps:

&#10122; Clone the repository and run the server

```
git clone https://github.com/fonoster/routr
docker-compose up 
```

&#10123; Connect to Routr using Zoiper or another softphone

In the `config/resources`, you will find the `domains.json` and `agents.json` files. Those files contain the configuration to run a simple local network with two SIP Agents (John and Jane).

### Deploying in development mode with Gitpod

Routr's one-click interactive deployment will familiarize you with the server in development mode.

### Kubernetes

Deploying Routr in Kubernetes is coming soon.
