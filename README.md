## Deployment

### Instant Server Installation with Snaps

Install Routr in seconds on Linux (Ubuntu and others) with:

```bash
sudo snap install routr-server rctl
```

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/routr-server)

For Linux deployments, Routr Snap is the recommended method of installation.

Installing snaps is very quick. By running that command, you have your full Routr server up and running. Snaps are secure. They are isolated, with everything they need to run. Snaps also auto-update when we release a new version.

### Docker

[Deploy with docker compose](https://routr.io/docs/guides/running-with-docker-or-compose/)

[![Docker logo](https://d207aa93qlcgug.cloudfront.net/1.95.5.qa/img/nav/docker-logo-loggedout.png)](https://hub.docker.com/r/fonoster/routr/)

Or use the automated build image of our [most recent release](https://hub.docker.com/r/fonoster/routr/)

```
docker pull fonoster/routr:latest
