Call events are a function of the EdgePort. To enable the NATs publisher, you will need to update your EdgePort service to set the environment variable NATSPUBLISHERENABLED to true as well as the environment variable NATSPUBLISHERURL to the URL of your NATs server. For example:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"connect/webrtc-support":{"id":"connect/webrtc-support","title":"WebRTC Support","description":"The Connect Processor supports interoperability with WebRTC clients. This means that you can use any SIP client that also supports WebRTC to make and receive calls, such as with the JavaScript libraries SIP.js and JsSIP for example. However, because WebRTC mandates the use of specific codecs, transport protocols, and a certain version of RTP that might differ from those used by legacy SIP clients, you will need to make additional configuration changes to your server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"contributing":{"id":"contributing","title":"Contributing","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/alterations/methods":{"id":"development/alterations/methods","title":"Alteration Methods","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/alterations/overview":{"id":"development/alterations/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/building-a-chat-application":{"id":"development/building-a-chat-application","title":"Building a Chat Application","description":"Comin soon."},"development/building-a-middleware":{"id":"development/building-a-middleware","title":"Building a Middleware","description":"Building a Middleware is the same as building a Processor.

Processors are where we can add new SIP headers, modify existing ones, add endpoints to the Location Service, etc. Processors are implemented as gRPC services and use the Alterations API to modify SIP messages. A Processor is the last stop for a SIP message before it is sent out to the network.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/building-a-scaip-processor":{"id":"development/building-a-scaip-processor","title":"Building a SCAIP Processor","description":"Comin soon."},"development/components/apiserver":{"id":"development/components/apiserver","title":"APIServer","description":"The APIServer is an optional component that can be used to describe a VoIP network in terms of Domains, Agents, Trunks, Numbers, and Peers.

As of the release of this publication, we only use this component when the network needs a Registry Service. However, this may change in the future, so be sure to check in to see if there are any other potential uses.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/rtprelay":{"id":"development/components/rtprelay","title":"RTPRelay","description":"The RTPRelay is an optional middleware service that can control RTPEngine instances.
