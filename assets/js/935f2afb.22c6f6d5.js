This means that you can use any SIP client that also supports WebRTC to make and receive calls, such as with the JavaScript libraries SIP.js and JsSIP for example. However, because WebRTC mandates the use of specific codecs, transport protocols, and a certain version of RTP that might differ from those used by legacy SIP clients, you will need to make additional configuration changes to your server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"contributing":{"id":"contributing","title":"Contributing","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/alterations/methods":{"id":"development/alterations/methods","title":"Alteration Methods","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/alterations/overview":{"id":"development/alterations/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/building-a-chat-application":{"id":"development/building-a-chat-application","title":"Building a Chat Application","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/building-a-middleware":{"id":"development/building-a-middleware","title":"Building a Middleware","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/building-a-processor":{"id":"development/building-a-processor","title":"Building a Processor","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/building-a-scaip-processor":{"id":"development/building-a-scaip-processor","title":"Building a SCAIP Processor","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/edgeport":{"id":"development/components/edgeport","title":"EdgePort","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/edgeport copy":{"id":"development/components/edgeport copy","title":"Message Dispatcher","description":"Comin soon."},"development/components/location":{"id":"development/components/location","title":"Location Service","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/overview":{"id":"development/components/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/pgdata":{"id":"development/components/pgdata","title":"PostgreSQL Data","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/registry":{"id":"development/components/registry","title":"Registry","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/requester":{"id":"development/components/requester","title":"Requester","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/rtprelay":{"id":"development/components/rtprelay","title":"RTP Relay","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/simpleauth":{"id":"development/components/simpleauth","title":"Simple Auth Service","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/components/simpledata":{"id":"development/components/simpledata","title":"Simple Data Service","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/development-mode-with-gitpod":{"id":"development/development-mode-with-gitpod","title":"Development with Gitpod","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/extending-the-apiserver":{"id":"development/extending-the-apiserver","title":"Extending the APIServer","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/extending-the-ctl":{"id":"development/extending-the-ctl","title":"Extending the CTL","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/introduction":{"id":"development/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/metrics-events-logs-and-traces":{"id":"development/metrics-events-logs-and-traces","title":"Everything about MELT","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/orchestration-with-docker":{"id":"development/orchestration-with-docker","title":"Orchestration with Docker","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/orchestration-with-kubernetes":{"id":"development/orchestration-with-kubernetes","title":"Orchestration with Kubernetes","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/quick-start":{"id":"development/quick-start","title":"Quick Start","description":"Comin soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"development/testing-with-seet":{"id":"development/testing-with-seet","title":"Testing with SEET","description":"Coming soon.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"faqs":{"id":"faqs","title":"FAQs","description":"What is Routr?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview/architecture":{"id":"overview/architecture","title":"Architecture","description":"Routr\'s architecture diagram","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"overview/concepts":{"id":"overview/concepts","title":"Concepts","description":"Routr\'s approach to SIP is different from other SIP servers.
